## Installation instructions

1. Clone Git repository, navigate to repository's root folder
2. Build the project: `swift build`
3. Execute `sh Assets/updateDaemon.sh` to load `*plist` file to `launchd`. This registers this service to be launched at user login. 
4. Check if the daemon runs without errors (for now...): `launchctl list | grep codeAlpha`. If there is an error, go investigate. ðŸ¤“

## Accepted Constraints

* [15.02.2022]: It is not yet gracefully handled when the user denys accessibility permissions. Right now, the app terminates but the XPC service keeps running. 

## Things done

For the beginning I will track my progress in this README. In the past this has served me well when learning many things at the same time.

### 17.02.2022

**AX Server logic:**
- [x] Improve routine to write to log file on disk
- [ ] Debug "getXCodeAppFocusStatus" method when called via XPC
- [ ] Continue testing server logic
- [ ] Change focus notification to "when editor goes in or out of focus"

**AX Server connectivity:**
- [ ] Debug XPC Interface for notifications 

**Client App:**
- [ ] Testing control flow

### 16.02.2022
