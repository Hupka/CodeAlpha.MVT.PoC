## Accepted Constraints

* [15.02.2022]: XCode must be running before widget app is started
* [15.02.2022]: It is not yet gracefully handled when the user denys accessibility permissions. Right now, the app terminates but the XPC service keeps running. 

## Things done

For the beginning I will track my progress in this README. In the past this has served me well when learning many things at the same time.

### 16.02.2022

**AX Server logic:**
- [ ] Write debug logs to file
- [ ] Debug "getXCodeAppFocusStatus" method when called via XPC
- [ ] Remove "RedString/GreenString" helpers
- [ ] Continue testing server logic

**AX Server connectivity:**
- [ ] Learn how to create anonymous listener from Client app
- [ ] XPC Interface for notifications 

**Client App:**
- [ ] Implement "listen" mode
- [ ] Implement proper CLI companion app
### 15.02.2022

**AX Server logic:**
- [x] Bind observer to XCode application, if XCode is open
- [x] Unbind observer when XCode is closed
- [x] Track when XCode editor area loses focus
- [x] Track when XCode editor goes (back) in focus
- [x] Add notification "AXValueChanged" to observer to track when user modified the content

**AX Server connectivity:**
- [x] XPC Interface for GETTERs

**Client App:**
- [ ] Implement "listen" mode
