# CodeAlpha.MVT.PoC

In preparation to build a _Minimum Viable Test (MVT)_ later this year, this project is a technical Proof of Concept (PoC).

## Technical Details

- Build with **Tauri**, an alternative to Electron. Tauri allows a much cleaner separation of _frontend_ and _backend_ in a desktop application, where the frontend is written in TypeScript and the backend is written in Rust.
- Frontend: TypeScript with Svelte and TailwindCSS
- Backend: Rust
